# About Lemon

- http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/

The Lemon program is an [LALR(1)]  [parser generator].
It takes a context free grammar and converts it into a subroutine that will parse a file using that grammar.
Lemon is similar to the much more famous programs "YACC" and "BISON".
But lemon is not compatible with either yacc or bison.
There are several important differences:

* Lemon using a different grammar syntax which is less prone to programming errors.
* The parser generated by Lemon is both re-entrant and thread-safe.
* Lemon includes the concept of a non-terminal destructor, which makes it much easier to write a parser that does not leak memory.

The complete source code to the lemon parser generator is contained in two files.


# Project Contents

Currently, this repository contains only the official version of Lemon (public domain) taken from the [SQLite] project:

- [`/lemon/`](./lemon/) — original Lemon sources from [SQLite]:
    + [`/examples/`](./lemon/examples) — user-contributed examples.
    + [`lemon.c`](./lemon/lemon.c) — parser generator program.
    + [`lempar.c`](./lemon/lempar.c) — template for the parser generator.
    + [`lemon.md`](./lemon/lemon.md) — documentation.

The `examples/` subfolder contains third-party examples based on this version of Lemon (the examples are not from the SQLite project).

There are many variations of the original Lemon code circulating over the Internet, and it's quite common to find tutorials and examples that rely on tweaked versions of Lemon, often in conjunction with other tools (like [re2c]).

To avoid confusion, in this project all examples are kept together with the Lemon version for which they were designed. Different versions of Lemon (forks, ports, etc.) will be kept in separate folders, and each version will have its own `examples/` subfolder. The idea is to keep the Lemon Grove tidy and well structured, so that its users can easily distinguish which version of Lemon is where, and how to find examples for that specific version.
